# Rendezvous Restaurant Frontend

This is the **frontend** of the Rendezvous Restaurant web application — a modern, clean, and responsive single-page app built using **React**, **Vite**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS** + **Sass**. It serves as the main interface for users to browse the menu, make reservations, check events, and give feedback.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React (with Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (configured with Sass)
